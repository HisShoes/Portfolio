				Hello! Thanks for visiting my portfolio site! It's a work in progress and more content should be up soon
				(and a shinier new design)

			<h3> ..Ok, but who are you? </h3>

		<div class="me">
			<h3> 
				I'm Ryan, a software developer currently based in Nottingham. I love technology, learning about and building software.
				Recently I've been having fun learning about web technologies, focussing on Python and Javascript, and looking 
				to develop my HTML and CSS skills further, including some frameworks.
			</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="me">
			<h3> 
				Outside of development I also like to hit the gym, play video games, go on hikes, mountain biking and slacklining. I used to play guitar in a band and now just practice on occasion, I used to take Japanese lessons and am a huge fan of Rick and Morty!
			</h3>

			<h3> What skills do you have?</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="visitor">
			<h3> Cool, so what work do you do?</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="me">
			<h3> 
				Well for the past year and a half I've been working as a contractor through QA, to deliver BPM applications. We help 
				automate business processes to increase efficiency (e.g. getting rid of paper, spreadsheets, manual emails).
			</h3>
		</div>


		<div class="visitor">
			<h3> But what qualifications/education do you have? </h3>
		</div>

		<div class="me">
			<h3> 
				Most recently I've picked up a few qualifications through work:
					<ul>
						<li>Pega CSSA </li>
						<li>Pega CSA </li>
						<li>Pega CCSA </li>
					</ul>
			</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="me">
			<h3> 
				I graduated with honours in Computer Games Technology from Abertay University. At university I studied maths,
				Android development, AI, graphics programming and more! I worked with a team of artists, designers and programmers
				to create a production ready game meeting a brief delivered by an Edinburgh based games company.
			</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="me">
			<h3> 
				In my final year I studied voxels, and created a (heavily simplified) simulation of hydraulic erosion
				of volumetric terrain for my honours project. The way a GPU can be used for general equations and the various
				methods of representing the terrain (Marching cubes) made this a really fun project.
